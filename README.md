SiriAPI8
========
SiriAPI8 opens Siri for your own purposes. You can use it to redirect any Siri command to any computer (Windows, Linux and Mac OS) without a Jailbreak. This is only API that works with iOS8. In opposite to previous implementations you don't even need to be in your homes network! When your server is running, you can use SiriAPI8.
I use SiriAPI8 for my home automation system to control the lights. Since I also developed the original SiriAPI which was compatible with iOS 7, I have a lot of experience in this matter and the basic algorithms were already tested by a big community. The use and installation of SiriAPI8 became much easier. You are not forced to use a Linux computer as a server anymore. Any operating system which is able to run the Python 3 interpreter will support this tool.

How does it work?
=================
Basically you just create notes with a keyword. By default you say "Create a note iPhone ...". In this case iPhone is the keyword. SiriAPI8 which runs on your own computer and doesn't send any information to other servers than Apple's your data keeps safe, scans your iCloud notes for this keyword. When the keyword is found, anything what you said after the keyword can be checked for predefined sentences and trigger your own Python scripts. The easy to use API helps you to concentrate on your plans and not the software.
